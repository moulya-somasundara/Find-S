# Find-S
Find-S Algorithm implementation in Python

This program produces the trace for the EnjoySport example by studying the number of random training examples required to exactly learn the target concept. 

Implemented a training example generator that generates random instances, then classifies them according to the target concept:    <Sunny, Warm, ?, ?, ?, ?>  

i have Run the experiment at least 20 times and reported the mean number of examples required.
